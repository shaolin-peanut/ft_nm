# ft_nm

What you need to do for this project, is reproducing the nm command (linux). You can use a vm OR docker, I recommend docker because it's much more dev friendly (fast to load, easy to set up etc, unlike vms).

What this project wants to teach you is what elf files are, and what purpose they have.

Elf is a format for binaries, either executables or objects.
